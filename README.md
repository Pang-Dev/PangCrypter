## Security Notes

- Losing the USB drive or password means data is likely impossible to restore.
- Store your USB drives safely and keep your password strong but memorable.
- Keep in mind that you are responsible for safeguarding your data; Pang HQ is not liable for any data breaches or leaks.
- Keys are stored in a hidden `.pangcrypt_keys` folder on the USB drive.
- As keys are generated with the drive id of the selected USB drive, moving a key to a different drive is impossible. Do not do this, it will not work.
